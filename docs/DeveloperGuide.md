## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1 2 3")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Add Student Command

#### Overview
The `addstudent` command is used to add a student to the address book with the information fields `Name`, `Phone`,
`Email`, `Address`, `LessonTime` and `Education`.

The format for the `addstudent` command can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#adding-a-student-addstudent)

#### Feature details
1. The user executes the `addstudent` command.
2. If any of the fields are not provided, an error message with the appropriate command usage will be displayed.
3. If any of the command parameters are invalid, an error message with the appropriate parameter format will be displayed.
4. The `Student` is then searched in the `model` to see if it is an existing person that the address book contains. If the person does
   exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If all the previous stages complete without exceptions or errors, the `Student` will be added to the `AddressBook`

The activity diagram for adding a `Student` into the address book

<puml src="diagrams/AddStudentActivityDiagram.puml" width="475" />

The sequence of the `addstudent` command is as follows:

1. The user inputs the `addstudent` command.<br>
   e.g. `addstudent n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 lt/mon:12:00 edu/Primary t/focused`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddStudentCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and
   a new `Student` and `AddStudentCommand` is created.
4. The `AddStudentCommand` checks if the `Student` is valid by calling `Model#hasPerson` and retrieves
   the module if the person exists in Address Book.
6. `AddStudentCommand` then attempts to add the module into the Model via `Model#addPerson`.
7. If `Student`, the user inputs are valid, and the Address Book does not contain the module, `AddStudentCommand` will
   successfully add the new `Student` into Address Book.

The following two *Sequence Diagrams* shows how the `addstudent` command works:

### Add Parent Command

#### Overview
The `addparent` command is used to add a student to the address book with the information fields `Name`, `Phone`,
`Email`, `Address`.

The format for the `addparent` command can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#adding-a-parent-addparent)

#### Feature details
1. The user executes the `addparent` command.
2. If any of the fields are not provided, an error message with the appropriate command usage will be displayed.
3. If any of the command parameters are invalid, an error message with the appropriate parameter format will be displayed.
4. The `Parent` is then searched in the `model` to see if it is an existing person that the address book contains. If the person does
   exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If all the previous stages complete without exceptions or errors, the `Parent` will be added to the `AddressBook`

The activity diagram for adding a `Parent` into the address book

<puml src="diagrams/AddParentActivityDiagram.puml" width="475" />

The sequence of the `addparent` command is as follows:

1. The user inputs the `addparent` command.<br>
   e.g. `addparent n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddParentCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and
   a new `Parent` and `AddParentCommand` is created.
4. The `AddParentCommand` checks if the `Parent` is valid by calling `Model#hasPerson` and retrieves
   the module if the person exists in Address Book.
6. `AddParentCommand` then attempts to add the module into the Model via `Model#addPerson`.
7. If `Parent`, the user inputs are valid, and the Address Book does not contain the module, `AddParentCommand` will
   successfully add the new `Parent` into Address Book.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit Person Command

#### Overview

The `edit` command is used to change the information fields (e.g. name, email and address) for person in the address book.

The format for the `edit` command can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#editing-a-person-edit).

#### Feature details

The edit mechanism uses `EditPersonDescriptor` to abstract out the fields to edit. It can be found as a publicly accessible class within `EditCommand`. Currently, it contains fields for `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `tags`, `lessonTime`, `education`, which are the only attributes of `Parent` or `Student` that can be edited for now. Besides this, it largely follows the parser and command structure as described in [Logic](#logic-component).

Below illustrates how `EditPersonDescriptor` is used.

Here is a *Sequence Diagram* showing the parser in action:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete Person Command

#### Overview

The `delete` command is used to delete a person from the address book. The person can only be deleted if it is already present in the address book.<br>

The format of the `delete` command can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#deleting-a-person-delete).<br>

#### Feature details

1. The user executes the `delete` command. <br>
2. If the index field is not provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown.
3. If invalid index field is provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown. 
4. If all previous steps are completed without exceptions, the `Person` will be successfully deleted from the address book.

<br>

The sequence of the `delete` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `delete` command.<br>
   e.g. `delete 1`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and a new `DeleteCommand` is created.
4. The `DeleteCommand` checks if the `index` is valid
5. If the `index` is valid and `Model` contains the persons, the `DeleteCommand` calls `Model#deletePerson` to delete the person from the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteParseSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteExecuteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Link Command

#### Overview

The `link` command is used to delete a person from the address book. The person can only be deleted if it is already present in the address book.<br>

The format of the `link` command can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#link-a-parent-to-a-student-link).<br>

#### Feature details

1. The user executes the `link` command.
2. If the index field is not provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown.
3. If invalid index field is provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown.
4. If all previous steps are completed without exceptions, the new `Person` will be successfully deleted from the address book.

<br>

The sequence of the `link` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `link` command.<br>
   e.g. `link ch/Alex Yeoh pa/Bernice Yu`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `LinkCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and a new `LinkCommand` is created.
4. The `LinkCommand` checks if the Student and Parent `name` is in the address book by calling `Model#personFromName`
5. If the Student `name` is valid and `Model` contains the person, the `LinkCommand` creates a new Student by calling `LinkCommand#createLinkedChild`.
6. If the Parent `name` is valid and `Model` contains the person, the `LinkCommand` creates a new Parent by calling `LinkCommand#createLinkedParent`.
7. `LinkCommand` updates the Student and Parent in the address book by calling `Model:setPerson`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `link` command works:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### [Proposed] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.

  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Private Tutor
* Teaches many students
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Tutors find it challenging to keep track of student information if they are teaching multiple students. They could be juggling additional administrative duties with their teaching duties. GOATS can enhance their efficiency by managing student and parent data, freeing up their time and allowing them to focus on other tasks.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Should work without internet connection
5. Saved data should be kept in a single file to allow for easy transfer to a different device.
6. The system should respond within two seconds.
7. Should work without having to use an installer or compiler.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A GUI is a form of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations.
* **API**: The Application Programming Interface specifies the interface through which software and other programs interact.
* **Main Success Scenario (MSS)**: The most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong.
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, is a common file format which stores data in key-value pairs and arrays.
* **Command**: A command is a specific instruction that you give to `GOATS` to perform a certain action, like adding a new participant to the list. Commands will be the primary way that you will interact with `GOATS`.
* **Parameter**: Parameters are pieces of data that must be passed to certain commands to tell `GOATS` which actions to perform. For example, the done command requires a single integer as a parameter so that it knows which event to mark as done.
* **Prefix**: Prefixes are unique identifiers in front of parameters so that `GOATS` understands what kind of values they are. For example, the prefix "n/" lets `GOATS` know that a name is expected to follow behind it, while the prefix "d/" lets `GOATS` know that a date is expected.
* **Archive**: A command that stores and removes all unused contact for later use, which can be retrieved by un-archiving.
* **Parent**: A person that is responsible for a Student.
* **Student**: A person studying under `user`
* **Education**: The education level of the Student
* **Grade**: The grade of the Student
* **LessonTime**: The tuition lesson time of the Student.
